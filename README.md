# NOBS SQL Editor

A desktop client for **MySQL** and **MariaDB** on Windows, built with
[Tauri](https://tauri.app) (a Rust backend with an HTML/JS frontend).

Only the Windows build is tested and released. Tauri also runs on macOS and Linux, so
you can build the app from source there (see [Building from source](#building-from-source)),
but there are no installers for those platforms and CI doesn't test them. Consider them
unsupported.

**Can't install software on your machine?** Use the
[PowerShell edition](https://github.com/monsama/nobs-sql-editor-powershell) instead. It has
the same interface, packed into a single `.ps1` script that starts a local server and opens
your browser. There is nothing to install, it needs no admin rights, and there is no
installer for SmartScreen to warn about. The trade-off is that it runs everything through
`mysql.exe`, so it needs the MySQL or MariaDB client tools, while the desktop app talks to
the server directly.

## Download

Windows installers are published on the
[Releases](https://github.com/monsama/nobs-sql-editor/releases) page.

They are **not code-signed**, so Windows SmartScreen shows a "Windows protected
your PC" warning naming an unknown publisher. Choose **More info -> Run anyway**
to continue.

Releases from 1.3.5 onward publish `SHA256SUMS.txt` next to the installers, and print
the same values in their notes, so you can check that what you downloaded is what CI
built (1.3.4 and earlier predate this):

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\NOBS.SQL.Editor_1.3.5_x64-setup.exe -Algorithm SHA256
```

[CODE_SIGNING.md](CODE_SIGNING.md) says what that does and does not prove, and why
there is no certificate.

### Uninstalling

1. To remove saved connections and their passwords as well, first open **Settings -> Clear all
   app data** in the app.
2. Uninstall **NOBS SQL Editor** from Windows **Settings -> Apps -> Installed apps** (or
   "Programs and Features").
3. Optionally delete what the app keeps for your user account:
   - `%APPDATA%\NOBSSQL-Desktop` - connections, settings, the query library, the log, and
     downloaded client tools;
   - `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ch.monsama.nobssqleditor` - the app window's browser data (open tabs,
     layout);
   - in Windows **Credential Manager** (Windows Credentials), any entries ending in
     `.NOBSSQL-Desktop` - saved connection passwords, if step 1 was skipped.

Export files are kept wherever you saved them.

## Features

- Connect to MySQL / MariaDB with saved connection profiles (passwords stored in
  the OS keychain), per-connection accent color, environment label, and a
  **read-only / safe mode** to protect production servers.
- SSH tunnels through the system's OpenSSH client (key, agent or password;
  host aliases and ProxyJump from ~/.ssh/config work too).
- Browse schemas and objects (tables, views, procedures, functions, triggers,
  events) with quick filtering.
- Tabbed SQL editor with syntax highlighting, autocomplete that knows the tables
  and aliases of the statement, find and replace (Ctrl+F / Ctrl+H), run whole
  script or selection, and result grids with per-column filtering and sorting.
  A procedure call, or a script with several SELECTs, shows each result in a tab
  of its own.
- Inline and full-row editing with a staged pending-changes model applied inside
  a transaction; add / delete rows. Typing with several cells picked writes the
  value into all of them. Right-click Apply (or Ctrl+Shift+S) to see the SQL
  it would run first.
- Manual transactions: with Auto-commit off a tab keeps one transaction open
  across its runs until Commit or Rollback. Commit also saves grid edits
  not applied yet; Rollback discards them. The count beside Commit opens
  the transaction's log: what it has run so far, how many rows each run changed,
  and how it went.
- Column resize and show/hide; row-detail form view for wide tables.
- Explain draws the plan: every table read as a card, a full scan in red and an
  index lookup in green, with the joins, sorts and subqueries around them.
- A result charts as bars or a line, from the rows the grid shows.
- Users and privileges: privileges as a checklist per server, database or table, with
  the GRANT and REVOKE shown before they run; roles and default roles; clone an
  account; sign-in method, SSL, password expiry and limits; who has access to a
  database; and a transfer script that carries roles and can run again.
- Export whole tables or query results to CSV or INSERT statements (streamed,
  handles large tables), or to Excel, JSON or Markdown; copy CSV/TSV/JSON to
  the clipboard.
- Table designer, DDL view/edit, users & privileges, table maintenance,
  CSV import, and a reusable query library (with export/import;
  a query can be saved to it straight from the history).
- Data export / import via the MySQL/MariaDB command-line tools: structure and data,
  structure only or data only, as a file per table, per database or one file.

## Keeping data exact

- **Saving grid edits:** each change is checked, inside the same transaction, to match exactly
  one row. Otherwise nothing is saved. This catches a row changed or deleted since it was loaded,
  and a TIMESTAMP key in the hour the clocks go back (it shows the same as its neighbour). FLOAT
  keys are shown rounded, so they are matched by their text.
- **Reading in another character set (read-only).** A value that reads `cafÃ©` is either stored
  wrong or being read wrong, and a grid cannot tell you which. The server transcodes text into
  the session's character set before sending it, so the box beside the connection lets you read
  the same rows in another one: UTF-8 bytes stored in a latin1 column read as mojibake in utf8mb4
  and as themselves in latin1, while data that is genuinely damaged reads badly in both. Nothing
  can be written while this is on - what is shown is not what a write would store - and the
  connection itself is opened read-only at the server, not only in the app.
- **Grid edits go to the database the query ran in**, including after a leading `USE`.
- **Compare runs both connections in UTC.** TIMESTAMP values therefore copy correctly between
  servers in different time zones, and Compare shows them in UTC.
- **Copies name their columns** (Compare, Duplicate table, INSERT exports). Invisible columns are
  included; generated columns are left out, since the server computes them. CSV exports include
  every column, and the CSV import skips generated ones.
- **INSERT exports skip rows whose key already exists** (`ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`). They used
  `INSERT IGNORE`, which also cuts a value that does not fit instead of failing.
- **The CSV import is strict.** Header names match the table's columns ignoring case. A column
  the table does not have, or a row with more or fewer fields than the header, imports nothing.
  Foreign key and unique checks stay on, and the whole file is one transaction.
- **A per-table export is one snapshot.** The whole database is dumped once and then split into
  one file per table or view, so the files are consistent with each other even while the database
  is being written to. Two tables whose names give the same file name get two files.
- **Schema sync writes each column as the source server defines it**, including its character
  set, collation, comment and generated expression.

## SSL / TLS

Each connection has an SSL mode, and optionally a CA certificate (a `.pem` file) that the two
verifying modes check the server against.

| Mode | Encrypted | Certificate checked against the CA | Host name checked |
|---|---|---|---|
| `default` | as negotiated | – | – |
| `disabled` | no | – | – |
| `required` | yes | no | no |
| `verify-ca` | yes | yes | no |
| `verify` | yes | yes | yes |

Without a CA, the verifying modes check against the Windows trust store.

**If the server uses the certificate MariaDB or MySQL generated for itself** - which is what you
get when nobody configured one - use **`verify-ca` with the server's CA**. That certificate is
self-signed, so no trust store accepts it, and it never names a real host (MySQL's is issued to
`MySQL_Server_<version>_Auto_Generated_Server_Certificate`), so `verify` refuses it even with the
right CA. The connection error says which of the two happened.

Where to get the CA: for MySQL it is `ca.pem` in the server's data directory. MariaDB's generated
certificate has no separate CA - use the certificate itself. Either can also be read off the
connection, which needs no access to the server's files:

```sh
echo | openssl s_client -starttls mysql -connect HOST:PORT -showcerts
```

The CA is the last certificate printed (for MariaDB, the only one).

Export and Import run the command-line client (below) with the same settings. The MariaDB client
has no way to check a CA without also checking the host name, except on connections to the local
machine, so there `verify-ca` is carried out as full `verify`. It never checks less than you asked
for - at worst a remote export fails where a query on the same connection works.

## Client tools (mysql / mysqldump)

Export and Import use the official MySQL/MariaDB command-line tools. These are
**not bundled** with this application. On first use you can either point the app
at an existing install (Settings) or let it download the official MariaDB client
tools from mariadb.org on demand. The archive is checked against the SHA-256 that
MariaDB's own release API publishes for it before anything is unpacked, and a
mismatch installs nothing - the checksum comes from the API, not from the mirror
the bytes came from, so a redirected or altered download fails the check. If the
API lists no checksum, nothing is downloaded at all.

**MySQL servers get MySQL's own tools** when there are any: the two optional
"MySQL servers" paths in Settings, or else the newest MySQL Server installation
(`Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server *\bin`). Export and Import ask the server
what it is and pick the pair to match; MariaDB servers, and MySQL servers on a
machine without MySQL's tools, use the default pair. It matters because MariaDB's
mysqldump writes values into a MySQL table's generated columns, which MySQL
refuses when the dump is restored. Without MySQL's tools such an export is
refused rather than written.

**No MySQL installed?** Settings can download MySQL's own `mysql` and `mysqldump`
(the current 8.4 LTS release from dev.mysql.com). MySQL publishes Windows binaries
only as the full server archive, so this is a ~270 MB download of which about
14 MB is kept, in `bin\mysql\`. The archive is checked against the MD5 on MySQL's
download page before anything is unpacked, and a mismatch installs nothing. If
MySQL moves its page or files, `mysql_download_page` and
`mysql_download_url_template` (with `{series}`, `{version}`, `{file_name}`) in
the config file override the defaults.

## Updates

A few seconds after it starts, the app asks GitHub (`api.github.com`) for the latest release of
[nobs-sql-editor](https://github.com/monsama/nobs-sql-editor/releases). If a newer version exists, a small
notice with a link appears in the bottom-left corner. Nothing is downloaded or installed. The
request carries nothing beyond what any web request does: your IP address and a user agent
naming the app.

Hide the notice with its **×** and it stays hidden until the next version. Switch the check off,
or run it by hand, under **Settings → Updates**.
