// Fitting a column measures the column, not the screenful.
//
// Double-clicking a column's edge sizes it to its widest value. It used to size it to the widest
// cell the DOM held, and above 300 rows the grid only builds the rows around where you are
// scrolled - so the value that should have decided the width was usually not there to be measured,
// and the same column fitted differently depending on where you had scrolled to. The picking of
// what to measure is unit-tested (tests/ui/column-fit.test.mjs); what only this can show is that
// the fit reaches a row the grid never drew, and that it stops at the edge of the pane.
